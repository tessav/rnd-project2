## Project: Kinematics Pick & Place

---


**Steps to complete the project:**  


1. Set up your ROS Workspace.
2. Download or clone the [project repository](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project) into the ***src*** directory of your ROS Workspace.  
3. Experiment with the forward_kinematics environment and get familiar with the robot.
4. Launch in [demo mode](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd209/parts/7b2fd2d7-e181-401e-977a-6158c77bf816/modules/8855de3f-2897-46c3-a805-628b5ecf045b/lessons/91d017b1-4493-4522-ad52-04a74a01094c/concepts/ae64bb91-e8c4-44c9-adbe-798e8f688193).
5. Perform Kinematic Analysis for the robot following the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view).
6. Fill in the `IK_server.py` with your Inverse Kinematics code.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/972/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  

You're reading it!

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

Schematic of reference frames for kuka arm:<br><br>

DH parameters an be derived from the urdf file:<br>

Links | alpha(i-1) | a(i-1) | d(i-1) | theta(i)
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
0->1 | 0 | 0 | 0.75 | q1 
1->2 | -pi/2 | 0.35 | 0 | -pi/2 + q2
2->3 | 0 | 1.25 | 0 | q3
3->4 |  -pi/2 | -0.054 | 1.5 | q4
4->5 | pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q5
5->6 | -pi/2 | 0 | 0 | q6
6->EE | 0 | 0 | 0.303 | 0

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Individual transformation matrices about each joint:<br>
```python
# formula
def TF_Matrix(alpha, a, d, q):
        TF = Matrix([
            [           cos(q),           -sin(q),           0,             a],
            [sin(q)*cos(alpha), cos(q)*cos(alpha), -sin(alpha), -sin(alpha)*d],
            [sin(q)*sin(alpha), cos(q)*sin(alpha),  cos(alpha),  cos(alpha)*d],
            [                0,                 0,           0,             1]
        ])
        return TF

# Create individual transformation matrices
T0_1 = TF_Matrix(alpha0, a0, d1, q1).subs(DH_Table)
T1_2 = TF_Matrix(alpha1, a1, d2, q2).subs(DH_Table)
T2_3 = TF_Matrix(alpha2, a2, d3, q3).subs(DH_Table)
T3_4 = TF_Matrix(alpha3, a3, d4, q4).subs(DH_Table)
T4_5 = TF_Matrix(alpha4, a4, d5, q5).subs(DH_Table)
T5_6 = TF_Matrix(alpha5, a5, d6, q6).subs(DH_Table)
T6_EE = TF_Matrix(alpha6, a6, d7, q7).subs(DH_Table)
    
```
The generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link is T01_1 * T1_2 * .... * T6_G.
Two additional rotations are applied to the gripper frame:<br>
```
 R_z = rot_z(radians(180))
 R_y = rot_y(radians(-90))
 R_corr= simplify(R_z * R_y)
 ```

#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

And here's where you can draw out and show your math for the derivation of your theta angles.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
